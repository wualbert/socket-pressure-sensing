## About
The code in this repository is for reading and recording data using MATLAB from a Wheatstone-bridge force sensor.
An Arduino and [HX711](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879) are required.

## Required Libraries
A [library](https://github.com/bogde/HX711) for [HX711](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879) needs to be installed on the local Arduino IDE. 

## Hardware Configuration
Please follow the hookup guide on [Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/load-cell-amplifier-hx711-breakout-hookup-guide?_ga=2.261760585.538125730.1548091346-1858554380.1488043603). The Arduino is connected to a computer through USB.
